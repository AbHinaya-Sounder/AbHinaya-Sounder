## 🔨 About me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning | Data Science | Cloud Computing
- 🎓 A curious explorer in Data Science, AI, and Software Engineering
- 🔭 Currently working on projects involving Edge AI, Driver Safety Systems, and UI/UX Design
- 🌱 Constantly learning Azure AI, Generative Models, and Front-End Engineering
- 💡 Passionate about solving real-world problems and building impactful tech

## 🔨 What I'm Currently Working On
- 🤖 Hackathon Participant:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- An innovation project for Tata Technologies Hackathon 3.2.1: AI-powered Co-Pilot for Smart Vehicles
- Integrating Edge AI models to enhance driver safety systems
- Preparing a demo and GitHub repo with clean UI, diagrams, and documentation
- An assistive AI system for non-verbal individuals that translates signs, gestures, or actions into text or speech, helping them communicate effectively.
- The core idea is to bridge the communication gap between people who cannot speak and others (especially those who may not understand sign language).
- Using Computer Vision, AI, and Speech Synthesis to recognize gestures and convert them into natural language output.
- Exploring technologies like OpenCV, MediaPipe, Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs, and possibly Edge AI for real-time implementation.
